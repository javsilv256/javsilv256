### Hi there, I'm Javier Silva-Valencia 👋

I am a Medical Doctor (MD) and a Biomedical Informatician (MSc). I am from Peru but now I am based in Antwerp - Belgium, where I am finishing a Master of Public Health (MPH) at the ITG Institute of Tropical Medicine.

Since 2018 I have been passionate about research in epidemiology, health data management, and the analysis of health information systems. If you found value in something I've created, please feel free to shout out or contact me if you need it.



I’m an iOS developer, writer and public speaker. I'm the creator of We Read Too, a book resource app that features books for kids and teens with main characters of colors written by Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous authors. I'm currently a Leaders for Global Operation Fellow at MIT pursuing a dual degree MBA and Masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Calm and a iOS Engineer at Slack.

📱 I’m currently working on We Read Too.
🤓 Continually learning SwiftUI.
💬 Ask me about iOS development, Swift, accessibility.
