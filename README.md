Hi there, I'm Javier 👋
I’m an iOS developer, writer and public speaker. I'm the creator of We Read Too, a book resource app that features books for kids and teens with main characters of colors written by Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous authors. I'm currently a Leaders for Global Operation Fellow at MIT pursuing a dual degree MBA and Masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Calm and a iOS Engineer at Slack.

📱 I’m currently working on We Read Too.
🤓 Continually learning SwiftUI.
💬 Ask me about iOS development, Swift, accessibility.
