### Hi there, I'm Javier Silva-Valencia ðŸ‘‹

I am a Medical Doctor (MD) with a background in Public Health (MPH) and a Biomedical Informatician (MSc). I am from Peru but I am based in Ontario - Canada.
Since 2018 I have been passionate about research in epidemiology, health data management, and the analysis of health information systems. If you found value in something I've created, please feel free to shout out or contact me if you need it.

Until now I have had experience in the analysis of big public health data in PerÃº and Canada and the development of interventions with ICT (Telehealth) for the promotion and prevention of health in rural Ã¡reas; as well as in the management of large health databases. I have been working in the Telehealth Unit of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) and in the Public Health Center at the National Institute of Health (INS) in Peru. I am also a Professor at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del PerÃº, at the Faculty of Public Health at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and a professor of EpiStat at the Faculty of Medicine for postgraduate studies at UNMSM.
